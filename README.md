Thirteen Virtues is a web-application built on Ruby on Rails for tracking your daily progress on the
life virtues that matter to you. Choose from one of Benjamin Franklin's infamous
13 virtues, the accrued list from the community or create your own virtues,
then come back daily and rate how you feel you are doing.

This is my Ruby on Rails application for my second semester at Nashville
Software School.

###This application requires:
* Ruby 2.1.2
* Rails 4.1.5

###Other Technologies
* HAML
* Foundation 5
* jQuery
* Sass
* RSpec/Capybara testing suite
* Poltergeist JS driver
* Postgres database
